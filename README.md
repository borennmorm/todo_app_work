# Flutter Todo App üìù

Welcome to my Flutter Todo App! This project is designed to showcase essential Flutter development skills such as state management, handling user input, and dynamically updating the UI. It's a practical tool that demonstrates how to create, manage, and search for tasks in a todo list. This README will guide you through the features of the app, how to run it, contribute to it, and where to find more of my work.
